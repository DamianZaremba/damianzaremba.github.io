You also have servers in each of the offices and want to access them as fast as possible.</p> <p>Keeping the links at layer 2 and blocking one (via something like STP) would give you gateway redundancy - if link A failed, link B would unblock and start forwarding traffic.</p> <p><img src="/2013/01/what-is-anycast-and-why-would-i-use-it/e-s-w_triangle-l2-failover.jpeg" alt=""/></p> <p>The problem here is you are having to go via Scotland to access Wales from England, when they have a direct link. You can't have both links up because you'd cause a loop and no traffic would pass.</p> <p>The solution is to make both links layer 3 and use a routing protocol to advertise the ranges over the top of them - there are reasons you'd want to use layer 2, or have one layer 2 and one layer 3, this is outside the scope of this example though.</p> <p>I'm not going to get into how to configure a routing protocol - there are a few to choose from, for this use case it doesn't hugely matter. Let's assume both links are the same speed and are direct (1 hop away).</p> <p>The topology looks something like</p> <p><img src="/2013/01/what-is-anycast-and-why-would-i-use-it/e-s-w_triangle-l3-routes.jpeg" alt=""/></p> <p>This means if any of the offices want to talk to another office, they are only 1 hop away and don't have to go though a middle man gateway - but if the direct link fails, they can be re-routed the long (2 hops) way around.</p> <p><img src="/2013/01/what-is-anycast-and-why-would-i-use-it/e-s-w_triangle-l3-routes-failure.jpeg" alt=""/></p> <p>In summary using routing between the 3 offices allows for transparent fail over and best-performance access. In a more complicated topology this is very useful.</p> <p>Essentially, this is also how 'Anycast' works - the main difference being is we're dealing with multiple nodes, rather than just re-advertising a single node (route). The routing doesn't care either way - it will choose the 'best' path based on what it knows about.</p> <h2>Why is this useful?</h2> <p>Anycast gives you a number of benefits such as</p> <ul> <li>Higher reliability/availability</li> <li>Higher performance</li> <li>Localisation/migration of DoS/DDoS attacks</li> <li>Client agnostic</li> </ul> <h2>Why doesn't everyone use it?</h2> <p>There are some drawbacks to using Anycast addressing</p> <ul> <li>Can be complex to deploy - requires an AS, addressing/routing management, more routes being advertised</li> <li>Can be expensive - IP space, network infrastructure, training</li> <li>Harder to troubleshoot</li> <li>Harder to monitor</li> </ul> <h2>How would I use it?</h2> <p>One of the most common use in for DNS services, however any stateless protocol can take advantage of Anycast - it is possible to use stateful protocols, however you need a much higher level of control and risk 'breaking' connections across 2 nodes.</p> <p>Imagine you where serving users out of Europe, US and Asia-Pacific.</p> <p>A common thing to do would be create 3 NS entries pointing to servers in each location</p> <div class=highlight><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">myawesomedns.something.    360 IN  SOA ns1.myawesomedns.something. root.myawesomedns.something.
