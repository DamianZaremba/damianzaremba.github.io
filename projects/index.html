This page highlights a few projects that I've been involved with.</p> <h2>Projects I Contribute To</h2> <p><em>See more on <a href="https://github.com/DamianZaremba?tab=repositories">GitHub</a></em></p> <h4>Puppet Sentry Plugin</h4> <p><a href="https://puppetlabs.com/">Puppet</a> reporter that sends run issues to <a href="https://www.getsentry.com/">Sentry</a></p> <p>Links: <a href="https://github.com/DamianZaremba/sentry-puppet">Source</a></p> <h4>ClueBot NG/ClueBot III</h4> <p>Currently run the ClueBot NG and ClueBot III instances on Wikimedia tool labs.</p> <p>Actively patch the bot/core/relay/report interface components to ensure it keeps running.</p> <p>Over 2.5 million edits on Wikipedia (number 6 in the number of edits by a bot, number 1 anti-vandal bot on the English Wikipedia).</p> <p>Score output is used by a number of other Human orientated tools, notably Huggle and Stiki.</p> <p>Links: <a href="https://github.com/damianzaremba/cluebotng">NG Source</a> | <a href="https://github.com/damianzaremba/cluebot3">III Source</a></p> <h2>Proprietary Projects I Lead</h2> <p><em>See more on my <a href="/cv/">cv</a></em></p> <h4>Multi Region, Multi AZ AWS Deployment</h4> <p>Highly available e-commerce set-up using Java/PHP on the public facing aspects and Java/MSSQL/Kafka/RabbitMQ on the back end.</p> <p>Deployed in a CI/CD manner, using Bamboo/CloudFormation/Code deploy to build and update stacks in the cloud. Tested via Chaos monkey and bespoke JMeter/Selenium based acceptance/load tests.</p> <p>Monitored via Cloudwatch, New relic and Pingdom; alerting via pager duty.</p> <p>'Light' front ends deployed in multiple regions, back end apps deployed in a single region with multiple AZs. Front end to back end communication via a mesh of IPSEC based VPNs providing inter-region connectivity.</p> <h4>Openstack Havana Deployment</h4> <p>Deployed an isolated 3 node (2 HA controllers) Openstack Havana set-up using NetApp ONTAP storage.</p> <p>Built from nothing to a full network, storage and compute implementation.</p> <p>Utilised Cisco 3750x/2960 switches (core/access) and the ASA 5515-X security appliance in a collapsed core design, providing redundant Gb access for core devices (EtherChannel bundles) and 192 Gb access ports.</p> <p>Redundant upstream connections to the firewall provided Gb access to the internal corporate network (100Mb access to remote RnD sites) and 100Mb public IPv4/IPv6 transit.</p> <h4>Load testing tools</h4> <p>Built a set of tools to load test a HTTP based service in a repeatable manner.</p> <p>Largely used JMeter - extended with its scripting interface - along with ApacheBench and a number of result processing tools.</p> <p>Also used gor with custom extensions for traffic mirroring where required.</p> <h4>DNS Stats Collector</h4> <p>Python based DNS sniffer, aimed at providing accurate DNS statistics on a per domain level.</p> <p>Logic to aggregate record stats and provide zone related stats (zone/subdomain vs record) with time based collecting to a central store for graphing and accounting.</p> <p>Handled >10 million DNS requests in POC stage with minimal issues.</p> <h4>Hosting migration tools</h4> <p>Developed a number of email and DNS migration tools for a company that was splitting away from its parent. Highly customised due to the source setup, migrated to a much more standard setup to improve ongoing support.</p> <p>Processed >15k DNS zones at the record level.</p> <h4>FTP Enforcer</h4> <p>Custom pureauth wrapper based security system for FTP. Designed for Shared/Reseller cPanel based hosting servers.</p> <p>Provides a cPanel and WHM interface, empowering end users and resellers alike to manage their FTP security.</p> <p>Successfully deployed to around 100 servers and is in active use.</p> <h4>DNS Cluster</h4> <p>Redesigned the back end 'DNS cluster' software for a hosting provider. Moved from a passive, custom apache vhost based system (which had multiple issues) to a server orientated system that could be actively interrogated for meta data as well as zones.</p> <p>Reworked the collector to be multi-threaded and reduced collection intervals. Also introduced a 'diff' based update, based on zones and zone serial numbers. Removed SPOFs and migrated to a multiple collector based system, so each DNS server could act independently.</p> <p>Also injected custom 'meta' records into the zones at the server level, enabling easy troubleshooting for support staff when looking at the live DNS servers</p> <h4>cPanel Dual/Triple stack PHP</h4> <p>Developed a custom system (with cPanel interface) for selecting PHP 5.2, 5.3 or 5.4 as the active version.</p> <p>Used in a shared hosting environment of about 60 servers to enable developers to run PHP 5.2 compatible apps while the default version on the server was PHP 5.3.</p> <p>Achieved using suphp and custom application handlers. Interface in cPanel then updated .htaccess files to activate the correct handler.</p> <h4>Email Depersonalizer</h4> <p>An Exchange 2010 custom transport agent, designed to rewrite all inbound and outbound email from a persons email address to their distribution list (primary DL stored in pager field).</p> <p>Functionality currently provided outbound by CodeTwo, which doesn't support Inbound rewriting and is rather quite flaky.</p> <p>Never deployed outside of a test setup.</p> <h4>Openfire DL based roster</h4> <p>Developed a bespoke roster management system for Openfire based on business requirements.</p> <p>Using custom attributes in Active Directory, hundreds of arbitrary groups where calculated and stored for Openfire to serve.</p> <h4>Email retention enforcement</h4> <p>Developed a set of tools to forcibly remove emails (PST files) from desktop machines spread around the world, based on SCCM polling results.</p> <p>Reported all removals/failures allowing a 'golden list' of outstanding files to be passed over to service desk staff for tracking down machines and manual removal.</p> <p>Designed to run continuously without alerting users, until exec mandated requirements where met.</p> <p>Also provided tools for checking which machines could be logged into remotely to enable pre-execution changes, such as re-enabling services via group policy.</p> </div> <footer class=footer> <div class=container> <p class=text-muted>Copyright 2009-2016 <a href="http://damianzaremba.co.uk">Damian Zaremba</a></p> <ul id=ads> <li>Need error tracking?
