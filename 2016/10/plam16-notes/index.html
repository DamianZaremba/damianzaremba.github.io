While there is no official release date yet, another 2 years or so is likely.</p> <p>Some companies are testing the DMR in production to weed out potential issues during the development.</p> <p>Some exciting features include</p> <h3>InnoDB by default!</h3> <p>MySQL 5.7 is still using MyISAM for system tables, 8.0 will see MyISAM still shipped, but completely optional due to the new <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/data-dictionary.html">data dictionary</a>.</p> <p>Another <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=78553">feature request</a> has been raised to move the storage engine to a plugin, with some comments suggesting a separate package.</p> <p>All the features in MyISAM have been implemented in InnoDB (5.6, 5.7), with MyISAM still performing better in some cases.</p> <p>Some key reasons why not to use MyISAM unless there's a specific use case (also applies to 5.6/5.7):</p> <ul> <li>Not ACID compliant</li> <li>Not transactional</li> <li>Repair + index rebuild required on crashes</li> <li>Table level locking</li> </ul> <h3>Invisible indexes</h3> <p>A very interesting feature, allowing you to hide an index from the query optimizer, but critically keep the index updated.</p> <p>There is a feature in MyISAM called 'disabled indexes', which has differing behaviour; this stops the index being maintained, requiring a rebuild of the index when it's re-enabled.</p> <p>Why is this useful?</p> <ul> <li><p>Dropping an index; once dropped rebuilding the index could be very time-consuming and in a production setting, this could have a significant effect on your applications. Hiding the index would reveal the same performance hit, with a low-cost rollback.</p></li> <li><p>Adding an index; creating a new index can cause the query plan to change, sometimes negatively. Currently, it's not possible to 'force' a hidden index to be on, this would be an interesting feature; enabling testing of critical queries.</p></li> </ul> <h3>IPv6 comparisons</h3> <p>INET6_ATON / INET6_NTOA were added in MySQL 5.6 however binary comparison has never worked properly. <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/worklog/task/?id=8699">WL#8699</a> has changed that.</p> <p>You can now do <code>INET6_ATON(address) &amp; INET6_ATON(network)</code> and the result is correct.</p> <p>A small change, but for certain applications, a lot of logic around v6 can now be treated the same way as v4.</p> <h3>JSON support</h3> <p>The JSON support continues to mature, with 2 new functions added in 8.0; JSON_ARRAYAGG &amp; JSON_OBJECTAGG.</p> <p>These functions work on tables without JSON fields, allowing logic such as:</p> <pre><code class="sql">mysql&gt; SELECT JSON_ARRAYAGG(`name`) AS `devices` FROM `assets` where `active` = b'1';
+--------------------------+
| devices                  |
+--------------------------+
| [ "device1",
    "device2",
    "device3" ]
|
+--------------------------+
</code></pre> <p>Or</p> <pre><code class="sql">mysql&gt; SELECT JSON_OBJECTAGG(`name`, `ip`) AS `devices` FROM `assets` where `active` = b'1';
+--------------------------+
| devices                  |
+--------------------------+
| { "device1": "127.0.0.1",
    "device2": "127.0.0.2",
    "device3": "127.0.0.3" }
|
+--------------------------+
</code></pre> <p>Other SQL logic should as grouping or joins can also be performed</p> <pre><code class="sql">mysql&gt; SELECT `location`, JSON_OBJECTAGG(`name`, `ip`) AS `devices` FROM `assets` where `active` = b'1' group by `location`;
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| location     | devices                                          |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| Amsterdam    | {"device1": "127.0.0.1", "device2": "127.0.0.2"} |
| Manchester   | {"device3": "127.0.0.3"}                         |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------+
</code></pre> <p>I'm not sure how much application/serialisation logic I want in my database, but this is definitely powerful.</p> <h3>CTE</h3> <p>This literally hurts my brain, seemingly it can be used in place of derived tables, with 1 powerful feature; you can recurse over the statement.</p> <p>In the case of a table being referenced to its self, it's now simple (and in some cases possible) to query the data in 1 pass.</p> <p>The CTE only knows about 1 row at a time, so for really complex items, columns have to be passed around (see <a href="http://mysqlserverteam.com/mysql-8-0-labs-recursive-common-table-expressions-in-mysql-ctes-part-two-how-to-generate-series/">this post</a> for a Fibonacci example).</p> <p>A simple example is as below:</p> <pre><code class="sql">WITH RECURSIVE crazy AS
(
  SELECT 1 AS counter
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 2 + counter FROM crazy WHERE counter &lt; 10
)
SELECT * FROM crazy;

+---------+
| counter |
+---------+
|       1 |
|       3 |
|       5 |
|       7 |
|       9 |
+---------+
</code></pre> <h3>Other stuff</h3> <p>Lots of other nice features have been added such as:</p> <ul> <li>Better docs</li> <li>Better GIS support</li> <li>Performance improvements</li> <li>Improved security models</li> <li>Query optimizer cost model improvements</li> <li>Support for the latest Unicode 9.0 standard</li> <li>UTF8MB4 as the default character set (work started in 5.7)</li> </ul> <p>Follow the <a href="http://mysqlserverteam.com/">MySQL server team</a> blog for updates.</p> <h1>ProxySQL</h1> <p>ProxySQL is a high-performance SQL proxy, supporting a number of interesting features:</p> <ul> <li>Query rewriting / blocking</li> <li>Load balancing / query routing</li> <li>Caching</li> <li>HA (when used with a topology manager)</li> <li>Traffic mirroring</li> </ul> <p>The HA part is especially interesting for a few reasons:</p> <ul> <li>Applications have their connection held, so you can have 'no downtime, increased latency' master failovers</li> <li>Servers can be promoted based on their read_only status</li> <li>Integration with cluster managers (Galera etc) is possible</li> </ul> <p><a href="http://www.tusacentral.net/joomla/">Marco Tusa</a> had a presentation on deploying ProxySQL, with an interesting overview of failover techniques and what 'HA' means:</p> <pre><code>90.000% (36 days) MySQL Replication
99.900% (8 hours) Linux Heartbeat with DRBD
99.900% (8 hours) RHCS with Shared Storage (Active/Passive)
99.990% (52 minutes) MHA with at least 3 nodes
99.990% (52 minutes) Linux Heartbeat with DRBD and Replication
99.990% (52 minutes) Linux Heartbeat with Shared Storage and Replication
99.995% (26 minutes) Multi-Master (Galera - Percona cluster) 3 node minimum
99.999% (5 minutes) MySQL Cluster
</code></pre> <h1>gh-ost</h1> <p>Think pt-online-schema-change without triggers, on steroids.</p> <p>The killer features include:</p> <ul> <li>No triggers, so 0 performance overhead when paused</li> <li>Dynamic throttling</li> <li>Hooks for notifications / cut-over</li> <li>Re-configurable at runtime</li> <li>Pauseable</li> </ul> <p>Currently, they're still using the <code>INSERT INTO xxx SELECT FROM yyy</code> pattern for the bulk row copy (binlog events played over the top), there is a feature request for this to be done via the gh-ost process; if that happens a number of really cool possibilities open up:</p> <ul> <li>No extra read load on the masters (and no touching the source table) - read data from slaves</li> <li>Live table migrations - no complex intermediary master setup for migrations/vertical sharding</li> <li>Sharding - with support for conditionals, slicing a table in 2 could be done in the same way as a live table migration</li> </ul> <p>The only catch is you need row based binlogs (binlog_row_image=FULL, though MINIMAL <a href="https://github.com/github/gh-ost/issues/230">has been requested</a>); this can be supported in a statement or mixed topology by having 1 slave log changes in the row format.</p> <h1>Facebook backups / binlog server</h1> <p>Facebook had a number of talks, 2 of which were on the topic of binlogs and backups.</p> <p>Interestingly their strategy is along the lines of:</p> <ul> <li>Backup binlogs as they rotate</li> <li>Stream binlogs into HDFS</li> <li><code>mysqldump</code> all databases every day</li> </ul> <p>The dumping process is interesting, as they take a full backup, but only save that every 5 days. The rest of the days, they compute the updated (+inserted) and deleted rows, then store that.</p> <p>When restoring a database/table they:</p> <ol> <li>Download the last full backup</li> <li>Download the diff backups between full...now</li> <li>Combine the full + diffs into 1 file</li> <li>Restore that file</li> <li>Replay the binlogs</li> </ol> <p>The only benefit I can see to this (over just storing the full backups) is saving on storage space (assuming &lt; 100% churn of the data).</p> <p>They have made multiple additions to the <code>mysqldump</code> binary (available in their <a href="https://github.com/facebook/mysql-5.6">mysql-5.6</a> branch), such as storing table offsets in comments.</p> <p>For restores, there is an orchestrated pipeline with a scheduler submitting automated restore requests to test backups; this has picked up failures in the process previously.</p> <p>To handle binlogs, they wrote their own binlog server, which can serve the files out of HDFS upon request; this is used to seed slaves and replay entries on restores.</p> <h1>MyRocks</h1> <p>It was <a href="https://www.percona.com/blog/2016/10/24/announcing-myrocks-in-percona-server-for-mysql/">announced</a> that Percona Server will be supporting MyRocks, this is exciting as previously you needed to run <a href="https://github.com/facebook/mysql-5.6">Facebook's branch</a> of MySQL.</p> <p>I've not yet had time to play with MyRocks, but some key stats posted by others when compared to InnoDB:</p> <ul> <li>1.5x more queries per second</li> <li>8x-14x less data written per transaction</li> <li>2x-3x less space used</li> </ul> <p>Follow <a href="http://smalldatum.blogspot.nl/">Mark Callaghan</a> for interesting RocksDB updates.</p> <h1>Percona Monitoring and Management</h1> <p>This is still pretty new, but there's a nice bundle of tools. I'm interested to see how this project matures and if the pain of MySQL Enterprise Monitor can be forgotten.</p> <p>There's an <a href="https://pmmdemo.percona.com/">online demo</a> if you want to play with it.</p> <h1>Database engine licensing</h1> <p>Peter Zaitsev's keynote reminded me of the excellent <a href="http://db-engines.com">db-engines.com</a> and their trends on licensing and usage.</p> <p>The <a href="http://db-engines.com/en/ranking_osvsc">popularity of Opensource engine</a>'s is growing with some of the biggest users of commercial licenses being their owners (Microsoft, Oracle).</p> <p>It also highlighted that most commercial offerings are around relational stores, with Opensource heavily present in wide column, graph, key-value and time series stores.</p> <p>A key takeaway for this segment was 'free' really means reduced TCO for business; they pay the support cost in people/consultancy etc but with a 3-10x reduction in TCO.</p> </div> </article> <section id=related> <h2>Related posts</h2> <ul id=related_posts> <li>&raquo; <a href="/2017/12/decoding-ipfix-options-using-go/">Decoding IPFIX options using Go</a></li> <li>&raquo; <a href="/2017/12/decoding-arista-ethertype-headers-with-gopacket/">Decoding Arista EtherType headers with gopacket</a></li> <li>&raquo; <a href="/2017/12/a-look-at-traffic-encryption-options/">A look at traffic encryption options</a></li> </ul> </section> <section id=comment> <h2>Comments</h2> <div id=disqus_thread aria-live=polite> <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the comments</noscript> </div> </section> <script type="text/javascript">var disqus_identifier="http://damianzaremba.co.uk/2016/10/plam16-notes/";var disqus_url="http://damianzaremba.co.uk/2016/10/plam16-notes/";(function(){var a=document.createElement("script");a.type="text/javascript";a.async=true;a.src="http://damianzaremba.disqus.com/embed.js";(document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0]||document.getElementsByTagName("body")[0]).appendChild(a)}());</script> </div> <footer class=footer> <div class=container> <p class=text-muted>Copyright 2009-2018 <a href="http://damianzaremba.co.uk">Damian Zaremba</a></p> <ul id=ads> <li>Need error tracking?
