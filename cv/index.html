<h3 id="traveljigsaw-limited-rentalcarscom---technical-architect">TravelJigsaw Limited (Rentalcars.com) - Technical Architect</h3>
<p><em>June 2015 - November 2015</em></p>

<p>As a founding member of the architecture team, my initial focus was a review of the core systems, potential contention/failure points and a roadmap for core infrastructure.</p>

<p>The work was varied and included documenting existing systems, interviewing candidates for multiple roles, providing expert support during service issues/solution design, building software prototypes, working with the teams to establish standards and designing new solutions.</p>

<p>As the only infrastructure-focused member of the team, a lot of alignment and collaboration with the 2 software architects was undertaken during this time.</p>

<p>Some key solutions that were designed and placed into production included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Internet connectivity, resolving redundancy issues and providing future scalability; this established the first ASN and IP space directly held by the company</li>
  <li>AWS direct connect for hybrid (test/development) environments; a successful PoC, now supporting multiple teams and production services</li>
  <li>‘Event backbone’ using Apache Flume and Kafka with custom consumers written in Java; a successful PoC handling millions of events a minute. This is now the standard way to transmit/consume events within the company and has a diverse set of backends (ElasticSearch, MySQL, AppDynamics, HDFS etc)</li>
</ul>

<p>Other outcomes included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An 18-month roadmap/improvement plan for the network</li>
  <li>Numerous risks identified within the technology landscape and prioritised for resolution with the engineering teams</li>
  <li>Implementation of Bamboo for CI, including multiple example jobs and Java-based plugins</li>
  <li>Implementation of Artifactory Pro for internal binary sharing (integrated into Bamboo and internal deployment systems)</li>
  <li>Updated design for a multistage Clos architecture within the data centres, with the budget accepted</li>
</ul>
